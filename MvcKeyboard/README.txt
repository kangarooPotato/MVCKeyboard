* Microsoft, do your job! *

..and now changed the index method!

* A LOT OF ERRORS *

- 20:05
There were a lot of errors, so I stopped the process and thought about what the problem would be, and I finally realized it.

When I first created the project, I capitalized it like the solution "MVC Keyboard".
However, it had to be made of "MvcKeyboard" based on the tutorial, so I think there was a lowercase capital letter problem in this part.

I don't have any more options
...Erase all files and restart the project!!!!!!

- 20:47
Added a controller and view parts

- 20:53
Added NuGet packages
Based on your ability to solve problems,
I installed version 5.0.14 and 5.0.2

- 20:57
I hope the addition of scaffolding works well.

- 20:59
Well, problems always happen... haha :(

- 21:02
Honestly, I don't know the reason, but I tried several times, and it worked.
