* A LOT OF ERRORS *

- 20:05
There were a lot of errors, so I stopped the process and thought about what the problem would be, and I finally realized it.

When I first created the project, I capitalized it like the solution "MVC Keyboard".
However, it had to be made of "MvcKeyboard" based on the tutorial, so I think there was a lowercase capital letter problem in this part.

I don't have any more options
...Erase all files and restart the project!!!!!!
