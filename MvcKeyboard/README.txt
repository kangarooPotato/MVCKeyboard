* Microsoft, do your job! *

..and now changed the index method!

* A LOT OF ERRORS *

- 20:05
There were a lot of errors, so I stopped the process and thought about what the problem would be, and I finally realized it.

When I first created the project, I capitalized it like the solution "MVC Keyboard".
However, it had to be made of "MvcKeyboard" based on the tutorial, so I think there was a lowercase capital letter problem in this part.

I don't have any more options
...Erase all files and restart the project!!!!!!

- 20:47
Added a controller and view parts

- 20:53
Added NuGet packages
Based on your ability to solve problems,
I installed version 5.0.14 and 5.0.2

- 20:57
I hope the addition of scaffolding works well.

- 20:59
Well, problems always happen... haha :(

- 21:02
Honestly, I don't know the reason, but I tried several times, and it worked.

- 21:13
Checked SQL Server Express LocalDB. I can see the all data. COOL!

- 21:23
We solved the problem of missing a comma (,) and not updating the database at all.

- 21:30
I can see all the data I put in SeedData..!!!
Move on perfectly to the next chapter :)

- 21:39
I slightly touched the layout and changed the color of Nav color and the font to red.

- 21:47
Controller actions and views part is done!
Now we are going to Add search part haha.

- 22:23
Add search is done and I checked now, and there are many warnings.
Seeing that it says 0/11132, this reminds me of a professor who will sigh.
I'm sorry in advance.

but it works very well. cool function!

- 23:03
add a rating property to the Movie Model and Build the app.
(don't forget the commend! it is Ctrl+Shift+B)

- 23:07
I didn't know why the rating wasn't displayed.
and i found the solution! if we erase all the data, the rating will be added when the form that we made comes up again..!!! awsome!!!
Add a new field done

It's fun to make codes, find problems, and build them again really!!! haha
:)
